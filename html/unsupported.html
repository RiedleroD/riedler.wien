		<h2>Uh-Oh!</h2>
		<b>Looks like you're using an unsupported browser!</b>
		<p>
			This is not because your browser lacks features, but for ethical reasons - Gianmarco said it best, so <a href="https://gianmarco.gg/blinky/">here</a> you go.<br/>
			<i>Note that this cannot be a false positive, as I check for an attribute within the javascript environment of the browser that tells me whether the browser is chromium based or not. If your browser marks itself as Chrome, that's its fault, not mine.</i><br/>
			<i>Note on that note: IE10 marked itself as chrome to ward off websites that tried to block non-chrome browsers (for featureset reasons) - I just hope you're not using IE10 is all</i>
		</p>
		<p>In any case, I recommend a Firefox-based browser, though I don't block Safari either. Take a look at this:</p>
		<section>
			<h3>Desktop</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://firefox.com/">Firefox</a> - Plain and main, this is for the average Joe. It's what I use and test my website on.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.waterfox.net/">Waterfox</a> - Firefox, with minor improvements. I haven't tried it myself :shrug:</li>
				<li><a href="https://librewolf.net/">Librewolf</a> - A privacy-centered Variant of Firefox.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">TOR Browser</a> - It's also based on FF. Not really meant for normal use, but I thought you might want to know that anyway.</li>
				<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_IceCat">GNU IceCat</a> - A free as in freedom FF variant. I get the feeling this is not what you care about.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Mobile <b>(mostly Android, since… yknow, sideloading)</b></h3>
			<span>I generally recommend using <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.marmaro.krt.ffupdater/">FFUpdater</a> for easier updates of FF-based browsers outside the play store.</span>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://firefox.com/">Firefox</a> - Yes, also avaliable on mobile. Note that there's limited extension support - including uBlock Origin and ABP!</li>
				<li>Iceraven - Basically just Librewolf, but on mobile. There's some more extensions enabled here.</li>
				<li>Mull - Very similar to mobile Firefox, but with a few small improvements. It's what I use and test my website on.</li>
			</ul>

			Yes, there's still other browsers. You could use IE11. Or WebKitGTK. Or Konqueror. But those are all pretty crap, since it's near impossible to keep up with …mainly google's pace of adding new features to the web standards. Mozilla is big enough and Apple can afford to not care, but all the others get left behind :(

			Ok, now that you've probably skimmed the page for the link that makes you go back, <a href="/?i_will_choose_a_better_browser_next_time">here it is</a>. Chromium is obviously still unsupported though, so no complaining about stuff being broken!
